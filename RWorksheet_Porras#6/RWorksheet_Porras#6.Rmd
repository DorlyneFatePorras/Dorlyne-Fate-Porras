```{r, error = TRUE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```


```{r, error = TRUE}
data(mpg)

waw <- as.data.frame(mpg)
waw
```

1. How many columns are in mpg dataset? How about the number of rows? Show the
codes and its result.

```{r, error = TRUE}
mpg_data <- glimpse(waw)
```

Answer: It has 11 columns and a row of 234

2. Which manufacturer has the most models in this data set? Which model has the most
variations?


```{r, error = TRUE}
manufact <- mpg_data %>% group_by(manufacturer,model) %>% count()
manufact
```

Answer: The manufacturer that has the most model are the Dodge while the most variations
for model arethe caravan2wd.

```{r, error = TRUE}
colnames(manufact) <-c("Manufacturer", "Model", "Counts")
```

a. Group the manufacturers and find the unique models. Copy the codes and result.

```{r, error = TRUE}
unique_data <- mpg_data %>% group_by(manufacturer) %>%
  distinct(model) %>% count()
unique_data
```

```{r, error = TRUE}
colnames(unique_data)<-c("Manufacturer", "Unique Counts")
```

b. Graph the result by using plot() and ggplot(). Write the codes and its result.


```{r, error = TRUE}
plot(manufact)
```

```{r, error = TRUE}
ggplot(manufact, aes(Manufacturer,Model)) + geom_point()
```

3. Same dataset will be used. You are going to show the relationship of the model and
the manufacturer.

```{r, error = TRUE}
ggplot(waw, aes(model, manufacturer)) + geom_point()
```

a. What does ggplot(mpg, aes(model, manufacturer)) + geom_point() show?
Answer: A point graph of a model and manufacturer of mpg data set.
  
b. For you, is it useful? If not, how could you modify the data to make it more
informative?
Answer: For me, It is useful but it can be more modify if there have a legend to easily
read the data.

4. Using the pipe (%>%), group the model and get the number of cars per model. Show
codes and its result.

```{r, error= TRUE}
cars_per_model <- mpg_data %>% group_by(model) %>% count()
cars_per_model
```

```{r, error = TRUE}
colnames(cars_per_model) <- c("Model","Counts")
```

a. Plot using the geom_bar() + coord_flip() just like what is shown below. Show
codes and its result.

```{r, error = TRUE}
qplot(model, data = waw,
main = "Number of Cars per Model",
xlab = "Model",
ylab = "Number of Cars", geom = "bar", fill = manufacturer) + coord_flip()
```

b. Use only the top 20 observations. Show code and results.

```{r, error = TRUE}
observations_twenty <- cars_per_model[1:20,] %>% top_n(2)
observations_twenty
```

```{r, error = TRUE}
ggplot(observations_twenty, aes(x = Model, y = Counts)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "Identity") + coord_flip()
```

5. Plot the relationship between cyl - number of cylinders and displ
- engine displacement using geom_point with aesthetic colour = engine displacement. 
Title should be “Relationship between No. of Cylinders and Engine Displacement”.

```{r, error = TRUE}
ggplot(data = mpg_data, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = cyl, 
                                      main = "Relationship between No of Cylinders
                                      and Engine Displacement")) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(colour = "engine displacement"))

```

b. How would you describe its relationship?
Answer: The cyl is in the y axis and the disp is in the x axis that can easily read 
the clustered data, which indicate the engine displacement.

6. Get the total number of observations for drv - type of drive train
(f = front-wheel drive,r = rear wheel drive, 4 = 4wd) and class - type of class
(Example: suv, 2seater, etc.).
Plot using the geom_tile() where the number of observations for 
class be used as a fill for aesthetics.

```{r, error = TRUE}
ggplot(data = mpg_data, mapping = aes(x = drv, y = class)) +
  geom_tile(aes(fill = class))
```

b. Interpret the result.
Answer: The y axis is class and the x axis is drv. It graph the data and the data
is in the different colors.

7. Discuss the difference between these codes. Its outputs for each are shown below.

Answer:The two code are the same. In the code it says that the colour is both 
blue but in the first code the result is color red and in the smaller graph
unlike in the second code that the graph is bigger than the first graph and the result
is color blue.

Code #1
```{r, error = TRUE}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, colour = "blue"))
```

Code #2
```{r, error = TRUE}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), colour = "blue")
```

8. Try to run the command ?mpg. What is the result of this command?

```{r, error = TRUE}
command<-?mpg
command
```

Answer: The result of the code is the description or the data set of mpg.

a. Which variables from mpg dataset are categorical?
Answer: The Manufacturer, Model, Trans, drv, fl, class, cyl, cty, and hwy.

b. Which are continuous variables?
Answer: displ, year, cyl, cty, and hwy.

c. Plot the relationship between displ (engine displacement) and hwy(highway miles
per gallon). Mapped it with a continuous variable you have identified in #5-b.
What is its result? Why it produced such output?
Answer: The result have been graph and it shows that they are in the positive rate.


```{r, error = TRUE}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, colour = displ)) + geom_point()
```

9. Plot the relationship between displ (engine displacement) and hwy(highway miles
per gallon) using geom_point(). 
Add a trend line over the existing plot usinggeom_smooth() 
with se = FALSE. Default method is “loess”.

```{r, error = TRUE}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
geom_point(mapping = aes(color = class)) +
geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
```

10. Using the relationship of displ and hwy, add a trend line over existing plot.
Set the se = FALSE to remove the confidence interval and method = lm to check for linear
modeling.

```{r, error = TRUE}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) +
geom_point()+
geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = lm)
```
